## Prerequisites
Before we begin, you'll need the following:

- A WyldHost account
- A Discord account

- Getting Started

1. Login to your WyldHost account and create a new server.
2. Upload your bot files to your server. Make sure your main file is named index.js.

4. Start your bot by running node index.js.


## Creating Your Bot

2. Click on the Bot tab and then click Add Bot.
3. Customize your bot's name and profile picture if desired.
4. Copy your bot token and save it for later.
5. In your bot's code, include the following lines to initialize your bot:


```JS
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] });

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('messageCreate', msg => {
  if (msg.content === 'ping') {
    msg.reply('Pong!');
  }
});

client.login('your-bot-token');
```

6. Customize your bot's behavior by editing the message event listener.
